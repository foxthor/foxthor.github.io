                    <p>I am a Junior Web Devloper who is currently doing Front End Web development & studying various other I.T and Programming related fields. I have a passion for technology and art, Web Design combines those two things to create a digital presence for your business or personal page. I have always had a strong creative side and also a logical mechanical mind, building web pages brings these two facets together. I enjoy educating people on how to better their online presence, from building your first landing page, to SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) & online marketing. I can help you build your digital platform and boost your business potential.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>I am fascinated about how the internet is growing and its place in the world today. Everything in the material world is intertwining with the digital one, understanding this new world and its fast paced changes is extremely interesting.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    I am also learning video game programming, as video games have long been a passion of mine. As for many children video games are usually their introduction to technology. You can view and play a few of my games bellow in my portfolio.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When not coding/programming, studying I.T or designing new web pages I am a Financial Planner and work in a family practice called Complete Financial Solutions. We understand the importance of an effective online marketing strategy, so I.T related knowledge is invaluable even in the finance sector.</p>

                    <p>HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C,</a> the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.</p>

                    <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments.</p>

                    <p> Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-based, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include network, storage, or graphics APIs, relying instead upon APIs made available by its host environment.</p>

                    <p> jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT license. jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.</p>

GitHub offers both plans for private and free repositories on the same account which are commonly used to host open-source software projects.As of April 2017, GitHub reports having almost 20 million users and 57 million repositories, making it the largest host of source code in the world.

                    <p>Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.

Linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is used on 99.6% of the TOP500 supercomputers. </p>

It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.
					Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 107,000 stars and 48,000 forks.</p>

                    <p>You have probably heard it before but might not understand what it means or why its so important.
                    SEO or Search Engine Optimisation is a marketing practice of increasing the amount traffic to you page by ranking you higher with search engine algorithms. It also helps to get your website closer to the top of searchs, ranking higher in search results means more potential clients click on your page.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Having a functional Web Page and getting your SEO  in order is Vital to a successful business. Your Web Page is many times the first point of contact you have with your clients and as we all know first impressions matter. In this day and age Google is the first place people go to look for a business or to find out information, this is why SEO is so important to finding new customers and staying ahead of the pack.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Getting your SEO done properly can drastically change the inflow of new business you receive.
                    It is also something that is constantly evolving and keeping your results optimised is an ongoing process. Its something I take particular interest in because it doesn’t matter how good your page looks if no one sees it. </p>
